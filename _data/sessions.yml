  title: "Building APIs for an unreliable world"
  description: "|
    Networks and computing systems are unreliable. Connections drop or slow to
    a crawl. Hard drives break and systems turn off without warning. These
    issues affect public and private APIs alike, but can spell disaster for
    microservices, as unreliability can lead to inconsistency.

    In this talk, we will explore strategies for designing APIs that can help
    mitigate unreliability. We will look at how the details of an implementation
    can influence resilience. Finally, we will see how design and implementation
    influence each other for creating an API that is best suited to tackle
    unreliability."

  description: "Designing good applications is complex, involves analytical and creative thinking, as well as a lot of tedious, but necessary work. Defining a design language that cares about end users and empowers designers to create appealing and intuitive apps – while covering business needs and ensuring consistency – is a major challenge. We will share our insights and best practices based on our own journey."
